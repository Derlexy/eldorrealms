## Eldor Realms Lore

Ashes are all over the skies, the seas and the rivers carry the blood of battles, and the forests slowly disappear and give space for progress. It all started with a thunder, bringing form to the more immediate desires of Eldor, the creator of the universe. A full but empty land where the angry and uncontrolled seas meet the sharp rocks, and nothing else hangs over them but four of the most beautiful creatures that have ever inhabited this slice of the universe. It was then that Haziel, the first of the four angels, began to change this scenario. Through his poetry, Haziel separated the seas from the rocks, giving shape to the plains and their vegetation. Linryel, the second of the angels, through his poetry, formed the forests and rivers that spreads through Eldara. Inspired by his brothers, Darburiel, the third of the angels, lifted mountains and excavated caves and tunnels with his poetry. Balriel, the fourth of the angels, formed and filled with life all the animals and beasts that inhabit the lands of Eldara. And this was the first Act of Eldara.
Satisfied with the creation of his angels, Eldor, the creator of the universe, charged each of them with the mission of creating and giving life to beings capable of carrying the wisdom and intelligence of their creators. And so did Haziel, the first of the angels, giving life to the beings he called humans, and they inhabited his plains. So did the other angels. Linryel created and gave life to the elves, who came to inhabit the vast forests of Eldara. Darburiel, in turn, gave life to creatures of inferior stature to those of his brothers, called them Dwarves, and they proceeded to inhabit the higher mountains and deeper caves. Finally, Balriel, the fourth of the angels, was responsible for the creation of the so-called Orcs, who would inhabit the surroundings of the mountains and forests of Eldara. And this was the second Act of Eldara.
